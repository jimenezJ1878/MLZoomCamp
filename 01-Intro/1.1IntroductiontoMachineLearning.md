# 1.1 Introduction to Machine Learning

## Context
This section introduces machine learning (ML) using a simple example: predicting the price of a car on a classifieds website. The ML model learns patterns from historical data and applies them to new, unseen data to predict prices.

## Problem Statement
Users who want to sell a car struggle to determine an optimal price. A price too high may deter buyers, while a price too low results in a financial loss.

## Manual Approach
People often review similar car listings, analyzing various features (e.g., year, mileage, manufacturer) to estimate a price. Experts use these same features to determine prices based on experience and the patterns they’ve learned from historical sales.

## Machine Learning Approach
Machine Learning can automate and replicate the expertise of a human by learning from historical data (prices, car features, etc.). ML can predict prices by analyzing similar features.

### Features and Target in ML
- **Features:** These are the attributes or characteristics of the car (e.g., year, manufacturer, mileage).
- **Target:** The variable you want to predict, which in this case is the **price**.

## ML Process Overview
1. **Data Collection:** Gather data on cars, including features like manufacturing year, mileage, and prices.
2. **Model Training:** The model learns the relationship between the features (input) and the price (output/target) by recognizing patterns from the data.
3. **Prediction:** Once trained, the model can predict the price of new cars based on their features, even if the price is not known in advance.

## How ML Replicates Expert Knowledge
Just as an expert uses experience and past data to estimate a car's price, an ML model uses historical data to learn patterns and make predictions. The expert’s intuition on the relationship between features (e.g., older cars being cheaper) is captured by the model through its training on the dataset.

## Key Takeaways
- **Machine Learning** is about extracting patterns from data to make predictions. The model encapsulates these patterns after training.
- The **features** describe the known information about the object (car), and the **target** is the value to predict (price).
- The model is trained using historical data and can predict new car prices based on input features.

## Model Predictions
ML models provide approximate predictions. While the exact price of a specific car might not be perfect, predictions are generally accurate **on average** based on historical patterns.

## Real-World Application
In practice, car sellers can use this model to get suggested prices for their cars, reducing the guesswork and improving pricing decisions.

## Next Steps
The next lecture will compare **Machine Learning** with **Rule-Based Systems** using a spam detection system as an example to highlight the differences between these two approaches.
